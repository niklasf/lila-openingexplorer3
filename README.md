Response: Streamed [`application/x-ndjson`](http://ndjson.org/)
with rows as follows.

Will start indexing, immediately respond with the current results,
and stream more updates until indexing is complete. The stream is throttled
and deduplicated. Empty lines may be sent to avoid timeouts.

Indexing process
----------------

At each point in time, there will never be more than one game stream requested
for each player, and no more than `--indexers` (default 16) in total.

Indexing requests are added to a bounded queue. If the queue is full,
the indexing request will be ignored.

Once started, indexing will run until completed, even if all requesters
disconnect.

Indexing requests are also ignored if they are submitted within 60 seconds of
the last indexing request for the same player, but there can be multiple
concurrent streams watching one indexing process. Ongoing games are revisited
only once every 24 hours.
